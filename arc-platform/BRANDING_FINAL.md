# ✅ Branding Clarification: Arcboard Platform for ARC Blockchain

## Correct Branding

### Platform Name: **Arcboard**
The onboarding platform/hub we're building

### Blockchain Name: **ARC**
The blockchain that the platform is about (https://docs.arc.network)

## What This Means

- **Arcboard** is the name of our **platform** (the website/application)
- **ARC** is the name of the **blockchain** that developers build on
- Users come to **Arcboard** to learn about and build on **ARC blockchain**

## Examples of Correct Usage

✅ **Correct:**
- "Welcome to Arcboard" (platform name in header)
- "Build on ARC Blockchain" (what users do)
- "Arcboard - ARC Blockchain Platform" (page title)
- "Get help with ARC blockchain development" (feature description)
- "Join the ARC ecosystem" (blockchain ecosystem)
- "ARC-specific tools and SDKs" (blockchain-specific)

❌ **Incorrect:**
- "Build on Arcboard Blockchain" (Arcboard is not a blockchain)
- "Arcboard ecosystem" (should be ARC ecosystem)
- "Arcboard-specific tools" (should be ARC-specific)

## Files Updated
